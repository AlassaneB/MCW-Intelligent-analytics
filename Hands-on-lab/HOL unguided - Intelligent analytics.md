5.  Review the label for the utterance "order a pizza" and set the intent to OrderIn and entity (pizza) to FoodItem

6.  Add new utterances for "Bring me toothpaste", "Bring me blankets", "Order a soda", and "Order me a pizza"

7.  Train the model

8.  Publish the model

9.  Test the model with the query "order me a pizza" and verify you get the intent of OrderIn (with a score close to 1.0) and entity pizza with a type of "RoomService::FoodItem"

10. Copy the App ID and Subscription Key from your LUIS app into and paste them into two new App settings within your Function App in the Azure portal: `luisAppID` and `luisKey` settings respectively

11. Complete TODO 13 in ProcessChatMessage.cs

12. Update the \_luisBaseUrl in ProcessChatMessage.cs to match that base URL from your LUIS app

_Exit criteria_:

- All TODO items in ProcessChatMessage.cs should be completed

### Task 3: Implement speech to text

There is one last intelligence service to activate in the application---speech recognition. This is powered by the Bing Speech API, and is invoked directly from the web page without going through the web server. In the section that follows, you insert your Cognitive Services Speech API key into the configuration to enable speech to text.

_Tasks to complete_:

1.  Add your Speech API Key under the TODO in scripts\\chatClient.js of the ChatWebApp project

_Exit criteria_:

- You should have all TODO items complete in chatClient.js

**Note**: Embedding the API Key as shown here is done only for convenience. In a production app, you will want to maintain your API Key server-side.

### Task 4: Re-deploy and test

Now that you have added sentiment analysis, language understanding, and speech recognition to the solution, you need to re-deploy the apps so you can test out the new functionality.

_Tasks to complete_:

1.  Publish the ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction Function App

2.  Publish ChatWebApp

_Exit criteria_:

- Open a browser and navigate to your deployed website using HTTPS. Use multiple browser instances or tabs to simulate multiple users.

- Send chat messages between them and verify that you see the sentiment indicator (a thumbs up or thumbs down icon next to each chat message)

- You can order something from room service, like "bring me towels" and you get a response from the ConciergeBot

- You can select the microphone to the left of the text box and speak for two to three seconds. Your spoken message should appear.

## Exercise 6: Building the Power BI dashboard

Duration: 30 minutes

Now that you have the solution deployed and exchanging messages, you can build a Power BI dashboard that monitors the sentiments of the messages being exchanged in real time. The following steps walk through the creation of the dashboard.

### Task 1: Create the static dashboard

_Tasks to complete_:

1.  Using PowerBI.com, create a new report from your streamed **Messages** dataset that contains a semi-circular gauge. It should chart the average score, with a range of 0.0 to 1.0.

_Exit criteria_:

- Your report should look like the following:

  ![A half-donut graph displays an Average score of 0.62.](media/image146.png 'Average of score donut graph')

### Task 2: Create the real-time dashboard

This gauge is currently a static visualization. You will use the report just created to seed a dashboard whose visualizations update as new messages arrive.

_Tasks to complete_:

1.  Create a new dashboard by pinning the gauge you created previously

2.  Open the new dashboard

3.  Enter the QA query "average score created between yesterday and today" and visualize it with the Gauge chart

4.  Format the chart so it ranges from 0.0 to 1.0 and has an indicator at 0.5

5.  Pin this visual to the dashboard you created

6.  Delete the old static chart from the dashboard

7.  Navigate to the ConciergePlus website and send some messages, observing that your Gauge updates in real time

8.  Add three additional visualizations so your dashboard looks as follows:

    ![The Power BI dashboard has four panes: two Count of Messages panes, an Average Sentiment, and Upset Users. The first Count of Messages pane displays a number (18). The second Count of Messages is a pie chart broken out by username. The Average Sentiment is a donut chart displaying the Average Sentiment (0.58) in the past 24 hours. Upset Users chart is a horizontal bar chart displaying the average of upset users (0.25) in the past 24 hours.](media/image158.png 'Power BI dashboard')

_Exit criteria_:

- Your chart should update in real-time and appear as above

### Task 3: Add a trending sentiment chart to the dashboard

The sentiment visualization you created is great for getting a sense of sentiment as of this moment. However, AdventureWorks Travel wishes to view sentiment over time for historical reference and to see whether overall sentiment is trending one way or another. To do this, we will use the tumbling window query output from Stream Analytics to display this data in a line chart.

_Tasks to complete_:

1.  Create a new report from the **TrendingSentiment** dataset

2.  The report should have a line chart with "snapshot" as the Axis, and "average" as the Values

3.  Save the report and pin this visual to the dashboard you created

_Exit criteria_:

- Your new line chart should display on the dashboard, showing the trending sentiment:

![Power BI dashboard showing the average score gauges and trending sentiment](media/power-bi-dashboard-with-trending-sentiment.png 'Power BI Dashboard')

## Exercise 7: Enabling search indexing

Duration: 30 minutes

Now that you have primed the system with some messages, you will create a Search Index and an Indexer in Azure Search upon the messages that are collected in Azure Cosmos DB.

### Task 1: Verifying message archival

Before going further, a good thing to check is whether messages are being written to Azure Cosmos DB from the Stream Analytics Job.

_Tasks to complete_:

1.  Using the Azure Portal, navigate to Data Explorer for your Cosmos DB Collection

_Exit criteria_:

- You should see a list of document IDs, similar to the following:

  ![Documents has been selected from within the Data Explorer in the Azure Portal.](media/image161.png 'Data Explorer')

  ![Message contents display.](media/image162.png 'Message contents')

### Task 2: Creating the index and indexer

_Tasks to complete_:

1.  In your Azure Search Index, use the Connect to your data feature to index the collection

2.  Provide any name for the index, but leave the Key set to id

3.  Ensure that the id, message, createDate, and username are Retrievable

4.  Ensure that createDate, username, and sessionId are Filterable

5.  Ensure that create date, username, and sessionId are Sortable

6.  Ensure that the message field is Searchable

7.  Create an Indexer with a 5-minute interval that starts today

_Exit criteria_:

- After a few moments, your indexer status should appear similar to the following:

  ![The Indexer displays Successes (1), and Failed (0).](media/image171.png 'Indexer')

### Task 3: Update the Web App web.config

_Tasks to complete_:

1.  Modify the web.config of the ChatWebApp project

2.  Set the chatSearchApiBase to the URI of the deployed Search API app

_Exit criteria_:

- You should have all app settings completed with values in the web.config

### Task 4: Configure the Search API App

_Tasks to complete_:

1.  Modify the web.config of the ChatApi project

2.  Set the SearchServiceName to the name of your Search service

3.  Set the SearchServiceQueryApiKey to the Key of your Search service

4.  Set the SearchIndexName to the name of the Index you created in Search

_Exit criteria_:

- You should have all app settings completed with values in the web.config

### Task 5: Re-publish apps

_Tasks to complete_:

1.  Publish the ChatWebApp

2.  Publish the ChatApiApp to your API App

_Exit criteria_:

- Navigate to the Search tab on the deployed Web App and try searching for chat messages (Note that there is up to a 5-minute latency before new messages may appear in the search results)

  ![A Search Message box displays over the Web App Search tab.](media/image182.png 'Web App Search tab ')

## Exercise 8: Add a bot using Bot service and QnA Maker

Duration: 30 minutes

At this point, you have created a real-time chat service in Azure, allowing people to interact with one another. Now we will build a bot that will automatically respond to user questions, helping take the load off the hotel staff.

### Task 1: Create a QnA service instance in Azure

_Tasks to complete_:

1.  Sign up for/into <https://www.qnamaker.ai> and create a new **knowledge base** into the same subscription and resource group as your other lab components

2.  Choose the **F** pricing tier

3.  Name your KB "Concierge Plus". [Download this file](lab-files/faq.xlsx) and use it to populate your KB.

4.  Add a **QnA pair** with "Hi" as the Question, and "Hello. Ask me questions about the hotel" as the Answer.

5.  Test and publish your service

_Exit criteria_:

- The Success page that appears after publishing. You have copied and saved the values for **Knowledge base ID**, **Endpoint HostName**, and **Auth Key** to Notepad or similar:

  ![Successful deployment](media/qna-maker-success.png 'Success')

### Task 2: Create a QnA bot

_Tasks to complete_:

1.  Create a new **Functions Bot** using the **Question and Answer (C#)** template

2.  After it is provisioned, update the Functions Bot's Application Settings with the values you copied at the end of the previous task into the **QnAAuthKey**, **QnAEndpointHostName**, and **QnAKnowledgebaseId** settings

3.  Update the settings to set the bot's display name to "Concierge+ Bot"

4.  Copy the bot's embed code, updating it with the Secret key, and paste it into the Views/Home/Bot.cshtml file within your web app, replacing `<!-- PASTE YOUR BOT EMBED CODE HERE -->`

5.  Add `width` and `hieght` values to your iframe, setting the values to "100%" and "300", respectively

6.  Publish your web app

_Exit criteria_:

- After the web app has been published, navigate to it and select the **Bot** menu item. You have typed in a few questions to ensure the bot is functioning correctly.

  ![Type in a few questions on the bot page](media/bot-service-embedded.png 'Bot page')

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 Minutes

In this exercise, attendees will deprovision any Azure resources that were created in support of the lab.

### Task 1: Delete the resource group

1.  Using the Azure portal, navigate to the Resource group you used throughout this hands-on lab by selecting Resource groups in the left menu

2.  Search for the name of your research group and select it from the list

3.  Select Delete in the command bar and confirm the deletion by re-typing the Resource group name and selecting Delete

You should follow all steps provided _after_ attending the Hands-on lab.
