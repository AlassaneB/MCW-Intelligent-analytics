# Abstract

## Workshop

This package is designed to facilitate learning real-time analytics without IoT. Participants will enable intelligent conversation in a machine learning-enabled, real-time chat pipeline to allow hotel guests to chat with one another, and to communicate directly with the concierge. They will also apply analytics to visualize customer sentiment in real-time. After completion, students will be better able to implement a lambda architecture, and enable web-based real-time messaging thru Web Sockets, Event Hubs, and Services Bus. In addition, participants will better understand how to:

-   Leverage Cognitive Services (LUIS & Text Analytics API)

-   Process Events with Web Jobs

-   Index with Search

-   Archive with Cosmos DB

-   Visualize with Power BI Q&A
