# Intelligent analytics hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

This hands-on lab is designed to provide exposure to many of Microsoft's transformative line of business applications built using Microsoft advanced analytics. The goal is to show an end-to-end solution, leveraging many of these technologies, but not necessarily doing work in every component possible.

By the end of the hands-on lab, you will be more confident in the various services and technologies provided by Azure, and how they can be combined to build a real-time chat solution that is enhanced by Cognitive Services.

## Overview

First Up Consultants specialize in building software solutions for the hospitality industry. Their latest product is an enterprise mobile/social chat product called Concierge+ (aka ConciergePlus). The mobile web app enables guests to easily stay in touch with the concierge and other guests, enabling greater personalization and improving their experience during their stay. Sentiment analysis is performed on top of chat messages as they occur, enabling hotel operators to keep tabs on guest sentiments in real-time.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you will build in this lab. Please study this carefully so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![The preferred solution is shown to meet the customer requirements. From right to left there is an architecture diagram which shows the connections from a mobile device to a Web Application. The Web Application is shown setting data to an Event Hub which is connected to a Web Job. From there Event Hub and Service Bus work together with Stream Analytics, Power BI and Cosmos DB to provide the full solution.](media/preferred-solution-architecture2.png "Solution architecture")

Messages are sent from browsers running within laptop or mobile clients via Web Sockets to an endpoint running in an Azure Web App. Chat messages received by the Web App are sent to an Event Hub where they are temporarily stored. An Azure Function picks up the chat messages and applies sentiment analysis to the message text (using the Text Analytics API), as well as contextual understanding (using LUIS). The function forwards the chat message to an Event Hub used to store messages for archival purposes, and to a Service Bus Topic which is used to deliver the message to the intended recipients. A Stream Analytics Job provides a simple mechanism for pulling the chat messages from the second Event Hub and writing them to Cosmos DB for archiving, a Service Bus queue for negative sentiment notifications, and to Power BI for visualization of sentiment in real-time as well as trending sentiment. A Logic App is triggered when messages are added to a Service Bus queue, and sends SMS messages to hotel staff when negative guest sentiment is detected in the chat. An indexer runs atop Cosmos DB that updates the Azure Search index which provides full text search capability. Messages in the Service Bus Topic are pulled by Subscriptions created in the Web App and running on behalf of each client device connected by Web Sockets. When the Subscription receives a message, it is pushed via Web Sockets down to the browser-based app and displayed in a web page. Bot Services hosts a bot created using QnA maker, which automatically answers simple questions asked by site visitors.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
- A virtual machine configured with:
  - Visual Studio Community 2019 or later.
  - Azure SDK 2.9 or later (Included with Visual Studio 2019).

## Exercise 1: Environment setup

Duration: 60 minutes

Synopsis: The following section walks you through the manual steps to provision the services required in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).  First Up Consultants have provided a starter solution for you. They have asked you to use this as the starting point for creating the Concierge Plus intelligent chat solution in Azure.

### Task 1: Connect to the lab VM

13. Now you can download files from the Internet. Download and install Google Chrome.

### Task 2: Download and open the ConciergePlus starter solution

1. From your Lab VM, download the starter project by downloading a .zip copy of the Intelligent analytics GitHub repo.

2. In a web browser, navigate to the [Intelligent analytics MCW repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Intelligent-analytics).

3. On the repo page, select **Clone or download**, then select **Download ZIP**.

    ![Download .zip containing the Intelligent analytics repository](media/git-hub-download-repo.png "Download ZIP")

4. Unzip the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to the folder **C:\\ConciergePlus**\\.

   >**Note**: Make sure to extract to this exact path. If you extract to a longer directory path, you will hit a Windows max 260 character path limit when you try to build the Visual Studio solution. You will not be able to download the NuGet packages. Keep the solution directory path short.

    ![In the Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders window, files will be extracted to C:\ConciergePlus.](media/image18.png 'Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders window')

5. Open **ConciergePlusSentiment.sln** in the `C:\ConciergePlus\Hands-on lab\lab-files\starter-project\` folder with Visual Studio 2019.

6. Sign in to Visual Studio or select create account, if prompted.

7. If presented with the Start with a familiar environment dialog, select Visual C\# from the Development Settings drop down list, and select Start Visual Studio.

    ![Development Settings are set to Visual csharp and are circled in the Visual Studio Start with a familiar environment dialog box.](media/image19.png 'Visual Studio Start with a familiar environment dialog box')

8. If the Security Warning window appears, uncheck Ask me for every project in this solution, and select OK.

    ![In the Security Warning window, under the Would you like to open this project? prompt, the Ask me for every project in this solution checkbox is circled.](media/image20.png 'Security Warning window')

    ![Initial solution folder and files](media/2019-03-20-15-58-31.png "Initial solution folder and files")

>**Note**: If you attempt to build the solution at this point, you will see many build errors. This is intentional. You will correct these in the exercises that follow.

>**Note**: Visual Studio Installer will show the installed version of Visual Studio and if the Azure SDK is installed. If the Azure SDK is missing, go back to the **Before the HOL** and make sure you created the correct VM. Updating Visual Studio manually may install components that may not work with the lab.

## Exercise 2: Implement message forwarding

Duration: 45 minutes

In this section, you will implement the message forwarding from the ingest Event Hub instance to an Event Hub instance and a Service Bus Topic. You will also configure the web-based components, which consist of two parts: The Web App UI and the Function App that runs the EventProcessorHost.

### Task 1: Implement the event processor

1. On your Lab VM, open the `ConciergePlusSentiment.sln` file that you downloaded using Visual Studio, if it is not already open.

2. Open `ProcessChatMessage.cs` (found within the `ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction` project in the Solution Explorer).

    ![Visual Studio is expanded as follows: ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction\ProcessChatMessage.cs](media/vs-process-chat-message.png "Visual Studio")

3. Scroll down to the Run method. This method represents the heart of the message processing logic utilized by the Event Processor Host running in an Azure function. It is provided a collection of EventData instances, each of which represent a chat message in the solution.

    ![Screen capture of the Run method](media/vs-function-run-method.png "Run method")

4. Locate TODO: 1 and replace the lines that follow the comment with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 1.Extract the JSON payload from the binary message
    var eventBytes = eventData.GetBytes();
    var jsonMessage = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventBytes);
    ```

5. Locate TODO: 2 and replace the line that follows with:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 2.Deserialize the JSON message payload into an instance of MessageType
    var msgObj = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<MessageType>(jsonMessage);
    log.Info(msgObj.message);
    ```

6. Locate TODO: 3 and replace the line that follows with:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 3. Create a BrokeredMessage (for Service Bus) and EventData instance (for EventHubs) from source message body
    var updatedEventBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(msgObj));
    BrokeredMessage chatMessage = new BrokeredMessage(updatedEventBytes);
    EventData updatedEventData = new EventData(updatedEventBytes);
    ```

7. Locate TODO: 4 and replace the lines that follow with:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 4.Copy the message properties from source to the outgoing message instances
    foreach (var prop in eventData.Properties)
    {
        chatMessage.Properties.Add(prop.Key, prop.Value);
        updatedEventData.Properties.Add(prop.Key, prop.Value);
    }
    ```

8. Locate TODO: 5 and replace the line that follows with:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 5.Send chat message to Topic
    await outputServiceBus.AddAsync(chatMessage);
    Console.WriteLine("Forwarded message to topic.");
    ```

9. Locate TODO: 6 and replace the line that follows with:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 6.Send chat message to next EventHub (for archival)
    await outputEventHub.AddAsync(updatedEventData);
    Console.WriteLine("Forwarded message to event hub.");
    ```

10. Save the file.

### Task 2: Configure the Chat Message Processor Function App

1. Navigate to your Function App in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). You can find it by opening your intelligent-analytics Resource Group and looking through the list of resources.

2. Select the **Configuration** link in the Overview blade of the Function App. Choose the **Application settings** link.

    ![The Overview tab is shown.  All options are presented. Click Configuration link for the Function App](media/2019-06-20-16-09-02.png "Configuration Link")

3. You will add the following application settings. The following sections walk you through the process of retrieving the values for these settings:

    ```javascript
    eventHubConnectionString
    sourceEventHubName
    destinationEventHubName
    storageAccountName
    storageAccountKey
    serviceBusConnectionString
    chatTopicPath
    textAnalyticsBaseUrl
    textAnalyticsAccountName
    textAnalyticsAccountKey
    ```

#### Event Hub connection string

The connection string required by the ChatMessageSentimentProcessor is different from the typical Event Hub consumer, because not only does it need Listen permissions, but it also needs Send and Manage permissions on the Service Bus Namespace (because it receives messages, as well as creates Subscriptions).

1. To get the **eventHubConnectionString**, navigate to the Event Hub namespace in the Azure Portal by selecting Resource Groups on the left menu, then selecting the intelligent-analytics resource group, and selecting your Event Hub from the list of resources.

    ![In the Name section of the Resource Groups pane, the awhotel-events-namespace Event Hub is circled.](media/image39.png 'Azure Portal, Resource Groups pane')

2. Select Shared access policies, under Settings, within the left-hand menu.

3. In the Shared access policies, you are going to create a new policy that the **ChatConsole** can use to retrieve messages. Select **+Add**.

    ![The Add button is circled in the Shared access policies pane.](media/image78.png 'Shared access policies pane')

4. For the New Policy Name, enter ChatConsole.

5. In the list of Claims, select Manage. Send and Listen will be automatically selected when you select Manage. Select the **Create** button.

    ![In the Add SAS Policy dialog box, Policy name is set to ChatConsole. Three check boxes are selected for Manage, Send, and Listen.](media/image79.png 'Add SAS Policy dialog box')

6. After the **ChatConsole** shared access policy is created, select it from the list of policies, and then copy the Connection string--primary key value.

    ![Two panes display: Shared access policies, and SAS Policy: Chat Console. In the Shared access policies pane, ChatConsole is selected. In the SAS Policy: ChatConsole pane, the Connection string-primary key is circled.](media/image80.png 'Shared access policies, and SAS Policy: Chat Console panes')

7. Return to the **Application Settings** for the Function App in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Select **+ Add new setting** at the bottom of the Application settings section.

    ![The screenshot displays how to add a new setting.](media/2019-11-16-12-39-18.png "Add new application setting.")

8. Enter **eventHubConnectionString** into the name field, and paste the copied value as the **value** field.  Select the OK button.

    ![Screenshot showing new application setting value](media/function-app-eventhubconnectionstring.png "Application setting value")

#### Event Hub name

Your event hubs can be found by going to your Event Hub overview blade, and selecting Event Hubs from the left menu.

![Event hubs overview blade](media/image81.png 'Event hubs')

1. For the **sourceEventHubName** setting in Application Settings, enter the name of your first Event Hub, **awchathub**.

2. For the **destinationEventHubName**, enter the name of your second Event Hub, **awchathub2**.

#### Storage account

Your storage accounts can be found by going to the intelligent-analytics resource group, and selecting the Storage account.

1. For the **storageAccountName** setting in Application Settings, enter the name of the storage account you created.

2. For the **storageAccountKey** enter the Key for the storage account you created (which you can retrieve from the Portal).

    - From your storage account's blade, select Access Keys from the left menu, under Settings.

      ![Under Settings, Access Keys is circled](media/image82.png 'Settings section')

    - Copy the Key value for key1, and paste that into the value for storageAccountKey in the App.Config file.

      ![In the Access Keys section, the value for Key1 and its copy button are circled.](media/2019-03-20-19-39-42.png 'Access Keys section')

#### Service Bus connection string

The namespace, and therefore connection string, for the service bus is different from the one for the event hub. We need to retrieve the shared access policy to allow the `ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction` **ChatConsole** permissions that was created earlier.

1. Navigate to the service bus overview. Choose the Shared Access policies link under Settings. Select the **ChatConsole** from the list of policies and copy the Primary Connection String value.

    ![The screen shows the service bus Shared access policies.  The ChatConsole policy is listed.](media/2019-11-16-12-53-19.png "Service Bus - Shared access policies")

    ![In the SAS Policy: ChatConsole blade, the Primary Connection String value and its corresponding copy button are circled.](media/image88.png "SAS Policy: ChatConsole blade")

2. Return to the Function App's Application Settings and paste this as the value for **serviceBusConnectionString**.

#### Chat topic

1. For the **chatTopicPath** application setting, enter the name of the Service Bus Topic you had created (e.g., awhotel). This can be found under Topics on the Service Bus overview blade.

    ![Service bus entities overview blade with topics selected.](media/image89.png 'Service bus entities overview blade')

#### Text Analytics API settings

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the Cognitive Service Text API (e.g. awhotels-sentiment). Locate the region the service was created in the Text Analytics Properties menu item.

   ![The screenshot shows the Text Analytics general properties. The region value is circled.](media/2019-11-24-09-37-48.png)

    Enter the region value under Endpoint into the **textAnalyticsBaseUrl** Function App setting. **Use all lower case alpha characters with no spaces.**

    ![The screenshot shows an example of the region value entered into the Function app settings field. The westus2 value is circled.](media/2019-11-24-09-41-40.png "Text Analytics Region Value")

    The region value will be used in a call to https://westus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.1/sentiment in the Function code.

2. On the left-hand menu of the Text API blade, select Keys.

    ![On the Cognitive Service account blade, the Name value (awhotels-sentiment) and its copy button are circled, as is the Key 1 value and its copy button.](media/image91.png "Cognitive Service account blade")

3. Copy the value of **Name** into the value attribute of **textAnalyticsAccountName** in the Function App's Application Settings.

4. Copy the value of **Key 1** from the blade into the value attribute of the **textAnalyticsAccountKey** in the Function App's Application Settings.

5. Scroll to the top of Application Settings and select **Save**. Your application settings should now resemble the following:

    ![A sample of the completed Application Settings is shown](media/2019-11-24-09-48-15.png "Function Application settings")

## Exercise 3: Configure the Chat Web App settings

Duration: 10 minutes

Within Visual Studio Solution Explorer, expand the `ChatWebApp` project and open `Web.Config`. You will update the settings in this file. The following sections walk you through the process of retrieving the values for the following settings:

```csharp
<add key="eventHubConnectionString" value=" "/>
<add key="eventHubName" value=" "/>
<add key="serviceBusConnectionString" value=" "/>
<add key="chatRequestTopicPath" value=" "/>
<add key="chatTopicPath" value=" "/>
```

>**Note**: These will be the same setting values you entered for the Function Application settings.

### Task 1: Event Hub connection String

1. Enter the **eventHubConnectionString**.

### Task 2: Event Hub name

1. For the **eventHubName**, enter the name of your first Event Hub (**awchathub**). This event Hub will receive messages from the website chat clients.

### Task 3: Service Bus connection String

1. Enter the **serviceBusConnectionString**.

### Task 4: Chat topic path and chat request topic path

1. For the **chatRequestTopicPath** and the **chatTopicPath**, enter the name of the Service Bus Topic you created, **awhotel**. The value is the same for both settings in this case.

2. The **web.config** should resemble the following. Select Save in Visual Studio.

    ![A web.config code window displays. ](media/image93.png 'web.config code window ')

## Exercise 4: Deploying the App Services

Duration: 15 minutes

With the App Services projects properly configured, you are now ready to deploy them to their pre-created services in Azure.

### Task 1: Publish the ChatMessageSentimentProcessor Function App

1. Within Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click the `ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction` project in the Solution Explorer, and select **Publish...**

    ![In Solution Explorer, the sub-menu for ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction displays, with Publish... selected.](media/vs-publish-function-menu.png "Solution Explorer")

    > **Note**: If you receive an error in the Output window, as a result of the publish process failing (The target "MSDeployPublish" does not exist in the project), expand the Properties folder within the Visual Studio project, then delete the PublishProfiles folder.

8. Repeat steps 1-5 to publish.

### Task 2: Publish the ChatWebApp

1. Within Visual Studio Solution Explorer, right-click the ChatWebApp project and select **Publish...**

    ![In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer ChatWebApp sub-menu, Publish is selected.](media/image100.png 'Visual Studio Solution Explorer')

2. In the Publish blade, select **App Service**, and choose the **Select Existing** radio button. Select **Publish**.

    ![In the Publish window, the Microsoft Azure App Service option is selected, as is the Select Existing radio button.](media/vs-webapp-publish-target.png "Publish window")

    You may see a different dialog than what is shown above. If so, select Microsoft Azure App Service:

    ![The screen shows the publish folder options. The web app is selected.](media/2019-11-16-13-31-12.png "Azure Web App Publish Options")

3. In the App Service dialog, choose your Subscription that contains your Web App you provisioned earlier. Expand your Resource Group (e.g., **intelligent-analytics**), then select the node for your **Web App** in the tree view to select it.

4. Select **OK**.

5. When the publishing is complete, a browser window should appear with content like the following:

    ![The Browser window displays the Contoso Hotels webpage, with a Join Chat window open below.](media/image104.png 'Browser window')

    > **Note**: It may take a couple of minutes for the browser to render. You must use a modern browser like Chrome or Edge.

### Task 3: Testing hotel lobby chat

1. Open a browser instance (Chrome is recommended for this web app), and navigate to the deployment URL for your Web App.

    - If you are unsure what this URL is, it can be found in two places:

      - First, you can find it on the ChatWebApp document in Visual Studio, that was opened when you published the Web App 

        ![In the Visual Studio ChatWebbApp tab, under Summary, the Site URL.](media/2019-06-20-17-53-33.png "Visual Studio ChatWebbApp tab")

      - Alternatively, this can be found in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) on the Overview blade for your Web App.

2. Under the Join Chat area, enter your username (anything will do).

3. Leave Hotel Lobby selected.

4. Select **Join**.

    ![The Join Chat window displays.](media/image107.png 'Join Chat window')

5. The Live Chat should appear. (Notice it auto-announced you joining to the room; this is the first message. Note, this may take a few seconds to appear.)

    ![The Live Chat window displays, showing that it is connected to the chat service.](media/image108.png 'Live Chat window')

6. Open another browser instance (You could try this from your mobile device).

7. Enter another username, and Select Join.

8. From either session, fill in the Chat text box and select Send. You can try using @ and \# too, just to seed some text for search.

    ![The Live Chat window shows a chat going on between two users.](media/image109.png 'Live Chat window')

9. You can join with as many sessions as you want (The Hotel Lobby is basically a public chat room).

    >**Debugging Tips**: If you don't see your messages showing up in the Live Chat window, double check your Azure Event Hub activity. Open the Metrics screen. Make sure incoming and outgoing messages are being processed.  Validate the WebChat web.config values match your Azure service configurations exactly. Also, if you navigate to the Azure Function Monitor, you can get more clues to any problems. Below is example of the log output. It can take up to 5 minutes for log entries to display.

    ![The screenshot shows an example of Azure Function log items. An error output is displayed.](media/2019-11-24-07-23-56.png "Azure Function Monitor Log Example")

## Exercise 5: Add intelligence

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will implement code to activate multiple cognitive intelligence services that act on the chat messages.

### Task 1: Implement sentiment analysis

In this task, you will add code that enables the Event Processor to invoke the Text Analytics API using the REST API and retrieve a sentiment score (a value between 0.0, negative, and 1.0, positive sentiment) for the text of a chat message.

1. In the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio, open `ProcessChatMessage.cs` in the `ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction` project.

2. Scroll down to the method **Run**.

3. Replace the code following TODO: 7 with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 7.Configure the HTTPClient base URL and request headers
    _sentimentClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Clear();
    _sentimentClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Clear();
    _sentimentClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key", _textAnalyticsAccountKey);
    _sentimentClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
    ```

4. Scroll down to the `GetSentimentScore` method and replace the code following TODO: 8 with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 8.Construct a sentiment request object
    var req = new SentimentRequest()
    {
        documents = new SentimentDocument[]
        {
            new SentimentDocument() { id = "1", text = messageText, language = "en" }
        }
    };
    ```

5. Replace the code following TODO: 9 with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 9.Serialize the request object to a JSON encoded in a byte array
    var jsonReq = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(req);
    byte[] byteData = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(jsonReq);
    ```

6. Replace the code following TODO: 10 with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 10.Post the request to the /sentiment endpoint
    // You need to enter the region.
    string uri = $"https://{_textAnalyticsBaseUrl}.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/text/analytics/v2.1/sentiment";
    string jsonResponse = "";
    using (var content = new ByteArrayContent(byteData))
    {
        content.Headers.ContentType = new MediaTypeHeaderValue("application/json");
        var sentimentResponse = await _sentimentClient.PostAsync(uri, content);
        jsonResponse = await sentimentResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
    }
    Console.WriteLine("\nDetect sentiment response:\n" + jsonResponse);
    ```

7. Replace the code following TODO: 11 with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 11.Deserialize sentiment response and extract the score
    var result = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<SentimentResponse>(jsonResponse);
    sentimentScore = result.documents[0].score;
    ```

8. Navigate to the Run method and replace the line following TODO: 12 with the following code:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 12 Append sentiment score to chat message object
    msgObj.score = await GetSentimentScore(msgObj.message);
    log.Info("SentimentScore: " + msgObj.score);
    ```

### Task 2: Implement linguistic understanding

In this task, you will create a LUIS app, publish it, and then enable the Event Processor to invoke LUIS using the REST API.

1. Using a browser, navigate to <http://www.luis.ai>.  

    >**Note**: If in Exercise 1, Step 12 you created your Luis account in Azure in an European region (e.g. West Europe), user <http://eu.luis.ai> instead. If you selected an Australian region use <http://au.luis.ai>.

2. Select **Sign in** **or create an account**.

    ![The Language Understanding Intelligent Service webpage with a Sign in or create an account button displays.](media/image110.png 'Language Understanding Intelligent Service webpage')

3. Sign in using your Microsoft account (or \@Microsoft.com account if that is appropriate to you). The new account startup process may take a few minutes.

4. Select **Accept**.

    ![The Accept button is clicked to agree to the LUIS Service App being connected to your account.](media/image111.png 'Accept button')

5. You should be redirected to the LUIS Welcome page at <https://www.luis.ai/welcome>. Scroll down and select **Create LUIS app**.

    ![The Create LUIS app botton is clicked form the Welcome page of the LUIS AI Service.](media/image112.png 'Create LUIS app')

6. Complete the additional info and terms of use form and select **Continue**.

    ![The Welcome to Language understanding webpage displays.](media/image113.png 'Welcome to Language')

7. Under My Apps, select **Create New App**.

8. Complete the Create a new app form by providing a name for your LUIS app, the culture and select **Done**.

    ![In the Create a new app dialog box, the Name field is set to awchat, and Culture is set to English.](media/image114.png 'Create new app')

9. In a moment, your new app will appear. Select the app to see the details.

10. In the menu bar, select **Train** and then **Publish**.

    ![The Publish dialog is shown with the region selected and the Add Key button clicked.](media/image115.png "Publish dialog")

    You should see a success message at the top of the screen.

11. Select My Apps from the menu bar and choose your app from the list.

12. Choose the top **Build** menu. Select **Create new intent**.

    ![The top menu bar is displayed. The Build menu item is circled.](media/2019-06-20-19-55-55.png "Build Menu Item")

13. In the Intents dialog, for the Intent Name enter **OrderIn** and select **Done**.

    ![The OrderIn intent has been entered into the Create new intent dialog and the Done button is clicked.](media/image118.png 'Create a new intent')

14. Select Entities from the menu on the left.

    ![The Entities menu item has been selected for the awchat application.](media/image120.png "Entities menu")

15. Select Create new entity.

    ![The Create new entity has been clicked for the awchat application. Create new entity circled.](media/2019-06-20-20-00-05.png "Create new entity")

16. For the Entity name specify "**RoomService**" and set the Entity Type to **Simple**.

    ![The Add Entity dialog is displayed. Name and Entity Type configurations are available.](media/2019-06-21-06-29-04.png "Add Entity dialog box")

17. Select the newly created **RoomService** entity.

18. Add a new role.

    - Enter **FoodItem** and hit the Enter key.
  
19. Repeat the same steps for Housekeeping entity and RoomItem role.

    ![The screenshot shows the finished entities list.](media/2019-11-24-10-56-53.png "LUIS Entity List")

20. Select **Intents** from the menu on the left and select the **OrderIn** intent you created.

    ![The screenshot shows the OrderIn intent that was created.](media/2019-11-24-10-59-26.png "OrderIn Entity")

21. Enter an utterance for this intent and match it with an entity and role.

    ![The pizza order example is entered into the utterance text box.](media/2019-11-24-11-06-18.png "Order a Pizza")

22. In the pizza utterance, select the word pizza so it becomes highlighted.  Under Entities select **RoomService**, then select **FoodItem**.

    ![In the Utterances (1) section, order a [pizza] is selected, and below that, RoomService displays with a chevron next to it.](media/2019-06-21-06-44-45.png "Utterances order a pizza")

23. Type a new utterance in the text box.  

    ![The screenshot displays the sample value entered into the utterance text box.](media/2019-11-18-18-39-15.png "New Utterance")

    Enter the following utterance:

    - Utterance: **bring me toothpaste**

    - Text to select: **toothpaste**

    - Entity: **RoomService:RoomItem**

24. Repeat this process for the following phrases (text to select is in bold):

    - **Bring me towels \| RoomService:RoomItem**

    - **Bring me blankets \| RoomService:RoomItem**

    - **Order a soda \| RoomService:FoodItem**

    - **Order me a hamburger \| RoomService:FoodItem**

      ![The utterances after they have been entered and aligned to the proper entities.](media/2019-06-21-06-51-43.png "Utterance list of room service items")

25. Select Train from the menu bar.

    ![Train menu bar selected/](media/image128.png 'Train menu bar')

26. Choose Test and experiment by writing some utterances and pressing enter to see the interpretation.

    ![An interactive test showing that searching for where can i buy a hamburger will invoke the entity RoomService::FoodItem. ](media/image129.png 'Test of utterances')

27. Select Publish App from the menu on the top.

28. When the publish completes, Refer to Keys and Endpoints under Manage in menu bar for Endpoint URL.

    ![The application settings menu is displayed. The Azure resources menu item is selected. The LUIS key information is displayed.](media/2019-11-18-18-58-03.png "LUIS Key Information")

29. This will open a new tab in your browser. Modify the end of the URL (the text following q= ) so it contains the phrase "bring me towels," and press ENTER. You should receive output similar to the following. Observe that it correctly identified the intent as OrderIn (in this case with a confidence of 0.9999995 or nearly 100%) and the entity as pizza having an entity type of Housekeeping:RoomItem (in this case with a confidence score of 96.9%).

    ![An example of the LUIS call JSON result is displayed.](media/2019-11-24-11-14-17.png "Sample LUIS Response")

30. In the URL, take note of three things:

    - The LUIS base URL, _highlighted_. Copy this value, and paste it into a text editor, such as Notepad, for later reference.
  
    ![The LUIS base URL is displayed.](media/2019-11-18-19-10-10.png "LUIS Base URL")

    - The GUID following apps/GUID/, _highlighted_. This is your App ID and you will need to use it in configuration later. It looks like the following:

    ![The screenshot displays a sample LUIS Url. The app id is highlighted.](media/2019-11-18-19-07-41.png "LUIS App ID")

      You can also find your App ID by going to the **Application Settings** tab.

    - The subscription-key value is the luis-api key value.

31. You can add more utterances as desired by repeating the above steps to add new utterances, indicate the entity, train the model, and then update the publish application using the button in the Publish App screen.

32. When you are ready to integrate LUIS into your app, go to the Manage option in menu bar, and locate the luis key under Resources and Keys. Copy the Key String. Paste this to your notepad.

    ![The luis-api key in the Publish App screen is selected.](media/luis-copy-key-string.png 'Resources and keys')

33. You will enter this into the configuration of the Event Processor Function App.

34. Select the Configuration link. Navigate to the Application Settings for your Event Processor Function App in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

35. Set the LUIS Application Settings.
- For the key **luisAppId** set the text of the value attribute to the App ID of your LUIS App (this value should be a GUID you obtained from the URL and not the name of your LUIS app).
- For the key **luisKey**, set the text of the value attribute to the subscription key used by your LUIS app.
- Set the **luisBaseUrl** to the LUIS base URL captured earlier.

    ![Set the luisAppId and luisKey values within the function app's app settings](media/2019-09-07-08-55-02.png "Function App application settings for LUIS")

36. **Save** your Application Settings. The Event Processor is pre-configured to invoke the LUIS API using the provided App ID and key.

37. Open Visual Studio then open `ProcessChatMessage.cs` within the `ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction` project, and navigate to the Run method.

38. Locate TODO: 14 and replace it with the following:

    ```csharp
    //TODO: 14.Respond to chat message intent if appropriate
    var intent = await GetIntentAndEntities(msgObj.message);
    await HandleIntent(intent, msgObj, outputServiceBus);
    ```

39. Take a look at the implementation of both methods if you are curious how the entity and intent information is used to generate an automatic chat message response from a bot.

40. Save the file.

### Task 3: Re-deploy and test

Now that you have added sentiment analysis and language understanding to the solution, you need to re-deploy the apps so you can test out the new functionality.

1. Publish the `ChatMessageSentimentProcessorFunction` Function App using Visual Studio just as you did in [Exercise 1, Task 1](#task-1-publish-the-chatmessagesentimentprocessor-function-app).

2. Publish the `ChatWebApp` just as you did in [Exercise 1, Task 2](#task-2-publish-the-chatwebapp).

3. Join a chat with the Hotel Lobby.

4. Type a message with a positive sentiment, like "I love this weather." Observe the "thumbs-up" icon that appears next to the chat message you sent. Next, types something like, "This weather is terrible," and observe the thumbs-down icon. These are indicators of sentiment (as applied by your solution in real-time).

    ![In the Live Chat window, callouts point to the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons. The 'love this weather' statement produces a thumbs-up icon. Thumbs down for the 'I have this weather'.](media/2019-09-10-12-31-51.png "Live Chat window")

5. Next, try ordering some items from room service, like "bring me towels" and "order a pizza." Observe that you get a response from the ConciergeBot, and that the reply indicates whether your request was sent to Housekeeping or Room Service, depending on whether the item ordered was a room or food item.

    ![In the chat window, Tim is having a conversation with a ConciergeBot. He asks for towels, and the ConciergeBot says they are forwarding the request to Housekeeping.](media/2019-09-10-12-33-18.png "Live Chat window")

## Exercise 6: Create Logic App for sending SMS notifications

14. Select **Create**.

15. On the next **Send Text Message (SMS)** dialog, enter the following:

    - **From Phone Number**: Select your Twilio phone number from the drop down.

    - **To Phone Number**: For this hands-on lab, you will enter your mobile phone number into this field. In a real-world app, you would most likely add another step into the Logic App to retrieve the target phone number from a database.

    - **Text**: Enter a message, such as "Guest [Name] appears to be upset in the hotel chat. This requires your immediate attention!" For [Name], select the **username** parameter from the **Dynamic content** items.
  
        Enter "Guest " + (username) + " seems upset in the hotel chat.  This requires your immediate attention!"

        ![The information above is entered in the next Send Text Message (SMS) dialog box.](media/2019-03-21-09-52-01.png "Send Text Message (SMS) dialog box")

16. Select **Save** on the **Logic Apps Designer** toolbar.

    ![Save is highlighted on the Logic Apps Designer blade toolbar.](./media/logic-app-designer-toolbar-save.png "Logic Apps Designer blade")

17. The Logic App will begin running immediately, so you should receive a text message on your phone within a minute or two of selecting Save, if there are messages already in the queue.

### Task 4: Add negative chat messages to trigger staff notifications

In this task, you will add messages to the chat containing negative sentiment to trigger notification messages through the Logic App.

1. Return to the chat application in your web browser, enter a username, and select **Join**.

    ![The Join Chat login box is displayed, with a username entered.](media/chat-app-login.png "Join Chat")

2. Enter a message with negative sentiment, such as "The service at this hotel is horrible!" and send the message.

    ![The Live Chat is displayed, and a message with negative sentiment, "The service at this hotel is horrible!" is entered into the chat message box.](media/2019-03-21-10-14-13.png "Live Chat - Hotel is Horrible")

3. Within a minute, you should receive a text notification at the phone number you specified when configuring the Logic App.

    ![The phone sample text is displayed. "Sent from your Twilio trial account - Guest guest seems upset in the hotel chat."](media/2019-03-21-10-16-30.png "Guest seems upset text message")

4. Test sending a "positive" message, and ensure you don't receive a notification.

## Exercise 7: Building the Power BI dashboard

Duration: 30 minutes

Now that you have the solution deployed and exchanging messages, you can build a Power BI dashboard that monitors the sentiments of the messages being exchanged in real time. The following steps walk through the creation of the dashboard.

### Task 1: Provision Power BI

If you do not already have a Power BI account:

1. Go to <https://powerbi.microsoft.com/features/>.

2. Scroll down until you see the Try Power BI for free! section of the page, and select the Try Free\> button.

    ![Screenshot of the Power BI Try for free section.](media/setup3.png 'Power BI Try for free section')

3. On the page, enter your work email address (which should be the same account as the one you use for your Azure subscription), and select Sign up.

    ![The Get started page has a field for entering your work email address.](media/setup4.png 'Get started page')

4. Follow the on-screen prompts, and your Power BI environment should be ready within minutes. You can always return to it via <https://app.powerbi.com/>.

### Task 2: Create the static dashboard

1. Sign in to your Power BI subscription (<https://app.powerbi.com>).

2. Select My Workspace on the left-hand menu, the select the Datasets tab.

    ![In the Power BI window, on the left menu, My Workspace is circled. In the right pane, Datasets is circled.](media/image140.png 'Power BI window')

3. Under the **Datasets** list, select the **Messages** dataset. Search for the Messages dataset, if there a too many items in the dataset list.

    ![On the Datasets tab, under Name, Messages is circled.](media/image141.png 'Datasets tab')

4. Select the **Create Report** button under the Actions column.

    ![On the Datasets tab, under Actions, the Create Report button is circled.](media/image142.png 'Datasets tab')

5. On the Visualizations palette, select **Gauge** to create a semi-circular gauge.

    ![On the Visualizations palette, the Gauge (donut) icon is circled.](media/image143.png 'Visualizations palette')

6. In the Fields listing, select and drag the **score** field and drop it onto the **Value** field.

    ![The Visualizations and Fields listings display. In the Fields listing, under Messages, the score check box is selected. An arrow points from this to the Value field in the Visualizations listing, where score is now listed.](media/image144.png 'Visualizations and Fields listings')

7. Select the drop-down menu that appears where you dropped score and select **Average**.

    ![Average is selected and a green checkmark displays next to it on the Drop-down menu.](media/image145.png 'Drop-down menu')

8. You now should have a gauge that shows the average sentiment for all the data collected so far, which should look similar to the following:

    ![A semi-circle gauge graph displays for Average of score, which is 0.62.](media/image146.png 'Gauge graph')

9. From the File menu, select Save to save your visualization to a new report.

    ![On the File menu, Save (Save this report) is selected.](media/image147.png 'File menu')

10. Enter **ChatSentiment** for the report name, and select **Save**.

    ![In the Save your report window, ChatSentiment is typed in as the name of the report.](media/image148.png 'Save your report window')

### Task 3: Create the real-time dashboard

This gauge is currently a static visualization. You will use the report just created to seed a dashboard whose visualizations update as new messages arrive.

1. Select the Pin Live Page icon located near the top right of the Gauge control.

    ![On the Gauge control menu bar, Pin Live Page is circled.](media/image149.png 'Gauge control menu bar')

2. Select New **dashboard**, enter **Real-time Sentiment** as the name, and select **Pin**.

    ![On the Pin to dashboard dialog box, on the left, a Preview of the ChatSentiment Gauge graph displays. On the right, under Where would you like to pin to, the New dashboard radio button is selected.](media/2019-06-21-09-41-59.png "Pin to dashboard dialog box")

3. Return to the **My Workspace** page, and select your newly created dashboard from the list of dashboards.

    ![My Workspace dashboards with Real-time Sentiment selected](media/image151.png 'My Workspace dashboards')

4. Real-time dashboards are created in Power BI using the Q&A feature, by typing in a question to visualize in the space provided. In the "Ask a question about your data" field, enter: "average score created between yesterday and today".

    ![The input text box Ask a question about your data](media/2019-03-21-10-26-35.png "Ask a question about your data")

    !["average score created between yesterday and today" is typed in the Ask question about your data field. An average of score (0.62) displays below.](media/image152.png 'Ask question about your data field')

5. Next, convert this to a Gauge chart by expanding the Visualizations palette at right, and clicking on the Gauge control.

    ![Visualizations palette with the Gauge control selected.](media/image153.png 'Visualizations palette')

6. Format the Gauge control so it ranges between 0.0 and 1.0 and has an indicator at 0.5. To do this, select the brush icon in the Visualization palette, expand the Gauge axis, and for Min enter 0, Max enter 1, and Target enter 0.5.

    ![In the Visualizations list, on the Visualizations palette, the Gauge graph icon is selected. Beneath that, the brush icon is selected. Under Gauge axis, the following values are defined: Min, 0. Max, 1.0. Target, 0.5.](media/image154.png 'Visualizations list')

7. Your gauge should now look similar to the following:

    ![The Gauge graph for average score created between yesterday and today displays with an average of score of 0.62.](media/image155.png 'Gauge graph')

8. In the top-right corner, select **Pin visual**.

    ![Pin visual option](media/image156.png 'Pin visual option')

9. In the dialog that appears, select the dashboard you recently created and select **Pin**.

    ![On the Pin to dashboard dialog box, on the left, a Preview of the Gauge graph displays. On the right, under Where would you like to pin to, the Existing dashboard radio button is selected.](media/image157.png 'Pin to dashboard dialog box')

10. In the list of dashboards, select your Real-time Sentiment dashboard. Your new gauge should appear next to your original gauge. If the original gauge fills the whole screen, you may need to scroll down to see the new gauge. You can delete the original gauge if you prefer. (Select the top of the visualization, then ellipses that appear, and then, the trash can icon.)

    ![Two Average of score Gauge graphs display, and both are the same.](media/image158.png 'Gauge graphs')

11. Navigate to the chat website you deployed and send some messages and observe how the sentiment gauge updates with moments of you sending chat messages.

### Task 4: Add a trending sentiment chart to the dashboard

The sentiment visualization you created is great for getting a sense of sentiment as of this moment. However, First Up Consultants wishes to view sentiment over time for historical reference and to see whether overall sentiment is trending one way or another. To do this, we will use the tumbling window query output from Stream Analytics to display this data in a line chart.

1. While still in Power BI, select **My Workspace** once again, then select the Datasets tab. Search for "Trending". You should see the **TrendingSentiment** dataset dynamically created by Stream Analytics. Select the Create Report action.

    ![Go to My Workspace, then the Datasets tab, search for Trending, then select the Create Report action.](media/power-bi-trendingsentiment-dataset.png "Power BI Datasets")

2. Select the **Line chart** visualization.

    ![Select the Line chart visualization](media/power-bi-line-chart-visualization.png "Power BI Line Chart")

3. Drag the **average** field to the **Values** setting, and **snapshot** to **Axis**.

    ![Drag the average field to the Values setting, and snapshot to Axis](media/power-bi-line-chart-settings.png "Power BI Line Chart")

4. Resize the line chart and observe how the average sentiment is tracked over time.

    ![Screenshot of the line chart displaying trending sentiment over time](media/power-bi-trending-sentiment-chart.png "Power BI Line Chart")

5. Select **Save this report** on the top of the page. Name the report "Trending Sentiment" when prompted..

    ![Select Save this report](media/power-bi-save-report.png "Save this report")

6. Next, select **Pin Live Page**.

    ![Select Pin Live Page](media/power-bi-pin-live-page.png "Pin Live Page")

7. In the Pin to dashboard dialog, select **Existing dashboard**, select the dashboard you created previously, then select **Pin live**.

    ![Pin to dashboard dialog](media/power-bi-pin-to-dashboard.png "Pin to dashboard")

8. Position the Trending Sentiment line chart beneath the average score gauge.

    ![Power BI dashboard showing the average score gauges and trending sentiment](media/power-bi-dashboard-with-trending-sentiment.png "Power BI Dashboard")

9. Try building out the rest of the real-time dashboard that should look as follows. We provide the following Q&A questions you can use to get started.

    ![The Power BI dashboard has four panes: two Count of Messages panes, an Average Sentiment, and Upset Users. The first Count of Messages pane displays a number (18). The second Count of Messages is a pie chart broken out by username. The Average Sentiment is a donut chart displaying the Average Sentiment (0.58) in the past 24 hours. Upset Users chart is a horizontal bar chart displaying the average of upset users (0.25) in the past 24 hours.](media/image159.png 'Power BI Dashboard')

    - Count of Messages (Card visualization): Count of messages between yesterday and today.

    - Count of Messages by Username (Pie chart visualization): Count of messages by username between yesterday and today.

    - Upset Users (Bar chart visualization): Average score by username between yesterday and today.

10. Invite some peers to chat and monitor the sentiments using your new, real-time dashboard.

## Exercise 8: Enabling search indexing

Duration: 30 minutes

Now that you have primed the system with some messages, you will create a Search Index and an Indexer in Azure Search upon the messages that are collected in Azure Cosmos DB.
